Computer Science Capstone Project from my Freshmen Fall of Undergrad

Note: this was written for vidle in Python 2.x if I remember correctly.

The final.txt document explains instructions in for how to play the game
and a couple minor things that were left unfinished (the sticking "bug"
could be fixed by just decreasing the update time window).

I coded this with a fellow student, but I specifically wrote the physics
engine as well as most of the board updates. We pair programmed for the
rest as our class wanted us to do.
